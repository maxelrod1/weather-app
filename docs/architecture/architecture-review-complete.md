# Architecture Review Complete

This architecture document provides all the technical details needed for AI agents to implement the Weather App. The design prioritizes:

✅ **Simplicity** - No backend, no database, minimal dependencies  
✅ **Zero Cost** - Free APIs, free hosting, free CI/CD  
✅ **Fast Development** - Modern tools (Vite), clear structure, comprehensive types  
✅ **Production Ready** - Testing strategy, error handling, monitoring, security  
✅ **Maintainable** - Clear patterns, typed interfaces, documented decisions  

**Next Steps:** Run Product Owner (PO) agent to shard this architecture into implementable documents, then begin development with Scrum Master (SM) and Developer (Dev) agents.
