# Weather App by Zip Code - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to quickly check weather conditions by entering a zip code
- Provide accurate, real-time weather data from a free and open data source
- Deliver a simple, intuitive web interface that works across devices
- Create a fully functional MVP that demonstrates API integration and data display

### Background Context

Many users need quick access to weather information for specific locations. While numerous weather apps exist, this project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for building a simple but complete web application. The app will demonstrate fundamental web development concepts including user input handling, API integration with free weather services, responsive UI design, and error handling. By keeping the scope focused on a single feature (zip code weather lookup), we can deliver a polished, working application quickly.

## Requirements

### Functional

- **FR1**: User shall be able to enter a US zip code in an input field
- **FR2**: User shall be able to submit the zip code to fetch weather data
- **FR3**: System shall fetch weather data from a free, open weather API (e.g., National Weather Service API or OpenWeatherMap)
- **FR4**: System shall display current temperature for the requested location
- **FR5**: System shall display weather conditions description (e.g., "Sunny", "Cloudy", "Rainy")
- **FR6**: System shall display location name corresponding to the zip code
- **FR7**: System shall validate that the entered zip code is in correct format (5 digits)
- **FR8**: System shall display appropriate error messages for invalid zip codes or failed API requests
- **FR9**: System shall display additional weather details: humidity, wind speed, and feels-like temperature

### Non Functional

- **NFR1**: The application shall respond to weather requests within 3 seconds under normal conditions
- **NFR2**: The application shall work on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - last 2 versions)
- **NFR3**: The user interface shall be responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes
- **NFR4**: The application shall use a free weather API that requires no payment or credit card
- **NFR5**: The code shall include basic error handling and logging for debugging
- **NFR6**: The application shall be deployable to a free hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application should present a clean, minimalist interface that puts the weather data front and center. Users should be able to immediately understand how to use the app without instructions. The design should feel modern and professional while remaining simple. Think "Google Search" simplicity - a single input field with clear results.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Single Page Application**: All interactions happen on one page without navigation
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual loading states when fetching data
- **Clear Error States**: Friendly error messages that guide users to correct input
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even if JavaScript fails

### Core Screens and Views

- **Main View**: Single screen with input field, submit button, and results area
- **Loading State**: Visual indicator when fetching weather data
- **Results Display**: Weather information presented in an easy-to-scan format
- **Error State**: Clear error messages with suggestions for resolution

### Accessibility

**WCAG AA compliance** - ensure keyboard navigation, proper ARIA labels, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader compatibility

### Branding

Clean, modern aesthetic with weather-appropriate color scheme (e.g., sky blues, cloud whites). Use contemporary typography and subtle animations for state transitions. No specific brand guidelines - create a fresh, professional look.

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - must work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with adaptive layouts

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single repository containing all frontend code and configuration

### Service Architecture

**Static Frontend with API Integration** - Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that calls external weather APIs. No backend server required - leverage free weather APIs that support CORS or use a lightweight serverless function if needed. Deploy as static site to free hosting platform.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** - Include unit tests for utility functions (validation, data parsing) and integration tests for API calls. Manual testing for UI/UX verification. Set up basic CI pipeline to run tests on commits.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Weather API Selection**: Use National Weather Service API (weather.gov) as primary choice - it's free, requires no API key, and provides reliable US weather data. Fallback option: OpenWeatherMap free tier.
- **Build Tooling**: Modern build setup with Vite or similar for fast development and optimized production builds
- **CSS Framework**: Use a lightweight CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS) or custom CSS for responsive design
- **JavaScript Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript or lightweight framework (React, Vue, or Svelte) - choose based on team preference
- **Environment Configuration**: Support for development and production environments
- **Deployment**: Configure for one-click deployment to Vercel or Netlify

## Epic List

### Epic 1: Foundation & Weather Lookup

**Goal**: Establish project infrastructure and deliver core weather lookup functionality that allows users to enter a zip code and see current weather conditions.

## Epic 1: Foundation & Weather Lookup

**Epic Goal**: Create a fully functional web application that enables users to enter a US zip code and view current weather information.
