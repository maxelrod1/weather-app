# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application should present a clean, minimalist interface that puts the weather data front and center. Users should be able to immediately understand how to use the app without instructions. The design should feel modern and professional while remaining simple. Think "Google Search" simplicity - a single input field with clear results.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Single Page Application**: All interactions happen on one page without navigation
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual loading states when fetching data
- **Clear Error States**: Friendly error messages that guide users to correct input
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even if JavaScript fails

## Core Screens and Views

- **Main View**: Single screen with input field, submit button, and results area
- **Loading State**: Visual indicator when fetching weather data
- **Results Display**: Weather information presented in an easy-to-scan format
- **Error State**: Clear error messages with suggestions for resolution

## Accessibility

**WCAG AA compliance** - ensure keyboard navigation, proper ARIA labels, sufficient color contrast, and screen reader compatibility

## Branding

Clean, modern aesthetic with weather-appropriate color scheme (e.g., sky blues, cloud whites). Use contemporary typography and subtle animations for state transitions. No specific brand guidelines - create a fresh, professional look.

## Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - must work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with adaptive layouts
