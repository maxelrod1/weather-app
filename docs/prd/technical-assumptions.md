# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single repository containing all frontend code and configuration

## Service Architecture

**Static Frontend with API Integration** - Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend that calls external weather APIs. No backend server required - leverage free weather APIs that support CORS or use a lightweight serverless function if needed. Deploy as static site to free hosting platform.

## Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** - Include unit tests for utility functions (validation, data parsing) and integration tests for API calls. Manual testing for UI/UX verification. Set up basic CI pipeline to run tests on commits.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Weather API Selection**: Use National Weather Service API (weather.gov) as primary choice - it's free, requires no API key, and provides reliable US weather data. Fallback option: OpenWeatherMap free tier.
- **Build Tooling**: Modern build setup with Vite or similar for fast development and optimized production builds
- **CSS Framework**: Use a lightweight CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS) or custom CSS for responsive design
- **JavaScript Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript or lightweight framework (React, Vue, or Svelte) - choose based on team preference
- **Environment Configuration**: Support for development and production environments
- **Deployment**: Configure for one-click deployment to Vercel or Netlify
