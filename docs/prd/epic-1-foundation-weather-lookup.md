# Epic 1: Foundation & Weather Lookup

**Epic Goal**: Create a fully functional web application that enables users to enter a US zip code and view current weather information. This epic establishes the project foundation (development environment, build configuration, deployment setup) while delivering the complete core feature - zip code input, API integration with weather service, and display of weather results with proper error handling.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to set up the project foundation with build tooling and basic HTML structure,  
**so that** I have a working development environment to build features.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Project initialized with package.json and appropriate dependencies (build tool, testing framework)
2. Basic HTML structure created with semantic markup
3. CSS reset or normalize applied for cross-browser consistency
4. Development server configured and running locally
5. Production build process configured
6. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore
7. README.md created with setup instructions and project description

## Story 1.2: Zip Code Input Form

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see an input field and submit button,  
**so that** I can enter a zip code to check the weather.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Input field displayed prominently with placeholder text "Enter ZIP code"
2. Input field accepts only numeric characters
3. Input field validates format (must be exactly 5 digits)
4. Submit button is clearly labeled (e.g., "Get Weather")
5. Submit button is disabled when input is invalid
6. Form prevents submission of invalid zip codes
7. Responsive layout works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
8. Input field is focused on page load for immediate use
9. Enter key submits the form

## Story 1.3: Weather API Integration

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to integrate with a free weather API,  
**so that** I can fetch weather data for zip codes.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. API client configured for National Weather Service API (weather.gov)
2. Function created to convert zip code to latitude/longitude (required for NWS API)
3. Function created to fetch weather data from API using coordinates
4. API responses parsed correctly to extract: temperature, conditions, location name, humidity, wind speed
5. Loading state managed during API calls
6. Network errors caught and handled gracefully
7. Invalid zip code responses handled (404 errors)
8. API rate limiting considered and handled if applicable
9. Unit tests created for API client functions

## Story 1.4: Weather Display Component

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see weather information displayed clearly,  
**so that** I can quickly understand current conditions for my zip code.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Location name displayed prominently
2. Current temperature displayed in large, readable font
3. Weather condition description shown (e.g., "Partly Cloudy")
4. Additional details displayed: humidity percentage, wind speed
5. "Feels like" temperature displayed
6. Weather icon or visual representation shown (if available from API)
7. Results area hidden until data is fetched
8. Results display is responsive across device sizes
9. Previous results are replaced when new zip code is submitted

## Story 1.5: Error Handling and User Feedback

**As a** user,  
**I want** to receive clear feedback when errors occur,  
**so that** I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Loading spinner or indicator shown while fetching data
2. Error message displayed for invalid zip code format
3. Error message displayed for zip codes not found (invalid location)
4. Error message displayed for network failures
5. Error messages are user-friendly and avoid technical jargon
6. Error messages disappear when user corrects input
7. Success feedback shows smoothly without jarring transitions
8. All states (loading, success, error) are visually distinct
9. Error logging implemented for debugging purposes

## Story 1.6: Deployment and Documentation

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to deploy the application and document its usage,  
**so that** users can access it online and team members can maintain it.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Application deployed to free hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify)
2. Deployment URL is accessible and functional
3. Environment configuration documented for deployment
4. README updated with live demo link
5. README includes user guide explaining how to use the app
6. README includes development instructions (install, run, test, build)
7. Basic CI/CD pipeline configured (run tests on PR)
8. Code comments added for complex logic
9. License file added (e.g., MIT)
