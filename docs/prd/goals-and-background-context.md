# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable users to quickly check weather conditions by entering a zip code
- Provide accurate, real-time weather data from a free and open data source
- Deliver a simple, intuitive web interface that works across devices
- Create a fully functional MVP that demonstrates API integration and data display

## Background Context

Many users need quick access to weather information for specific locations. While numerous weather apps exist, this project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for building a simple but complete web application. The app will demonstrate fundamental web development concepts including user input handling, API integration with free weather services, responsive UI design, and error handling. By keeping the scope focused on a single feature (zip code weather lookup), we can deliver a polished, working application quickly.
