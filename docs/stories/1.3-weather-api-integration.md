# Story 1.3: Weather API Integration

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to integrate with a free weather API,  
**so that** I can fetch weather data for zip codes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. API client configured for National Weather Service API (weather.gov)
2. Function created to convert zip code to latitude/longitude (required for NWS API)
3. Function created to fetch weather data from API using coordinates
4. API responses parsed correctly to extract: temperature, conditions, location name, humidity, wind speed
5. Loading state managed during API calls
6. Network errors caught and handled gracefully
7. Invalid zip code responses handled (404 errors)
8. API rate limiting considered and handled if applicable
9. Unit tests created for API client functions

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create

1. **src/types/weather.types.ts** - Weather data interfaces
2. **src/types/coordinates.types.ts** - Coordinates interfaces
3. **src/types/api.types.ts** - API response types
4. **src/services/http.client.ts** - Shared HTTP utilities
5. **src/services/geocoding.service.ts** - Zip to coordinates conversion
6. **src/services/weather.service.ts** - Weather data fetching
7. **tests/unit/services/geocoding.service.test.ts** - Geocoding tests
8. **tests/unit/services/weather.service.test.ts** - Weather service tests

### API Endpoints

**US Census Geocoding API:**
- Base: `https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/`
- Endpoint: `onelineaddress?address={zipcode}&benchmark=2020&format=json`

**National Weather Service API:**
- Base: `https://api.weather.gov`
- Endpoint 1: `/points/{latitude},{longitude}` - Get forecast URLs
- Endpoint 2: `/gridpoints/{office}/{gridX},{gridY}` - Get weather data

### Data Flow

```
Zip Code (12345)
  ↓
Geocoding Service → {lat: 40.75, lon: -73.99, name: "New York, NY"}
  ↓
Weather Service → NWS API /points/{lat},{lon}
  ↓
Weather Service → NWS API /gridpoints/{office}/{x},{y}
  ↓
Parse & Transform → WeatherData object
  ↓
Return to UI
```

## Technical Notes

- Use Fetch API (built-in, no dependencies)
- Include User-Agent header (required by NWS API)
- Handle CORS (NWS supports it)
- Parse nested JSON responses
- Transform API data into our interfaces
- Comprehensive error handling

## Definition of Done

- [x] TypeScript interfaces created for all data models
- [x] HTTP client with error handling
- [x] Geocoding service implemented and tested
- [x] Weather service implemented and tested
- [x] Loading states handled
- [x] Network errors caught and handled
- [x] 404 errors for invalid locations handled
- [x] Unit tests with >80% coverage
- [x] Integration with form component
- [x] Weather data displays in alert (Story 1.4 will add proper UI)
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Git commit with descriptive message

## Story Status

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Completed By**: Dev Agent
