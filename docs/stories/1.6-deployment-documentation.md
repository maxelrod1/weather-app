# Story 1.6: Deployment and Documentation

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to deploy the application and document its usage,  
**so that** users can access it online and team members can maintain it.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Application deployed to free hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify)
2. Deployment URL is accessible and functional
3. Environment configuration documented for deployment
4. README updated with live demo link
5. README includes user guide explaining how to use the app
6. README includes development instructions (install, run, test, build)
7. Basic CI/CD pipeline configured (run tests on PR)
8. Code comments added for complex logic
9. License file added (e.g., MIT)

## Implementation Details

### Deployment Platform: Vercel

**Why Vercel:**
- Free tier with generous limits
- Zero-config for Vite projects
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN
- Auto-deploy on git push
- Perfect for static sites

### Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare for Deployment**
   - Add `vercel.json` configuration
   - Update README with deployment info
   - Add LICENSE file
   - Ensure build works correctly

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
   - Run `vercel` in project directory
   - Follow prompts
   - Get deployment URL

3. **Configure Auto-Deploy**
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Enable automatic deployments
   - Every push to main → auto-deploy

### Files to Create/Update

1. **vercel.json** - Vercel configuration
2. **LICENSE** - MIT License
3. **README.md** - Update with deployment info
4. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Detailed deployment guide

## Technical Notes

- No environment variables needed (all APIs are public)
- No build-time secrets
- Static site - just HTML/CSS/JS
- CDN handles all static assets
- HTTPS automatic
