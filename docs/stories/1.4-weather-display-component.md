# Story 1.4: Weather Display Component

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see weather information displayed clearly,  
**so that** I can quickly understand current conditions for my zip code.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Location name displayed prominently
2. Current temperature displayed in large, readable font
3. Weather condition description shown (e.g., "Partly Cloudy")
4. Additional details displayed: humidity percentage, wind speed
5. "Feels like" temperature displayed
6. Weather icon or visual representation shown (if available from API)
7. Results area hidden until data is fetched
8. Results display is responsive across device sizes
9. Previous results are replaced when new zip code is submitted

## Implementation Details

### Files to Create

1. **src/components/WeatherDisplay.ts** - Weather display component
2. **src/utils/weather-icons.ts** - Weather condition to icon mapping
3. **src/styles/weather-display.css** - Weather card styles (if needed beyond Tailwind)

### Component Features

- **Large temperature display** - Main focal point
- **Location header** - City, State at top
- **Weather icon** - Visual representation of conditions
- **Details grid** - Humidity, wind speed, feels-like in cards
- **Smooth animations** - Fade in when data loads
- **Responsive design** - Stack on mobile, grid on desktop
- **Empty state** - Hidden until first weather fetch
- **Loading state** - Show during API calls (Story 1.5 will enhance)

### Visual Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  New York City, NY              │
├─────────────────────────────────┤

│       Partly Cloudy             │
│                                 │

└─────────────────────────────────┘
