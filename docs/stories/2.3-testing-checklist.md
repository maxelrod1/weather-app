## üìã Manual Testing Checklist

### üéπ Keyboard Navigation Testing

**Status:** ‚úÖ VERIFIED (Component is non-interactive)

The ApiJourneyAnimation component is a non-interactive status display:

- Doesn't trap or steal focus
- Background overlay has `pointer-events: none`

**How to Test:**
1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Tab through the form and page
3. Submit a zip code while animation is showing
4. Continue tabbing - verify focus moves normally
5. ‚úÖ Expected: No focus trapping or keyboard issues

### üé§ Screen Reader Testing

**Tools Needed:**
- **Mac:** VoiceOver (Cmd+F5 to enable)
- **Windows:** NVDA (free from nvaccess.org)
- **iOS:** VoiceOver (Settings ‚Üí Accessibility)
- **Android:** TalkBack (Settings ‚Üí Accessibility)

**Test Steps:**

1. **Enable Screen Reader**
   - Mac: Cmd+F5 (VoiceOver)
   - Windows: Start NVDA

2. **Navigate to Weather App**
   - Open http://localhost:5174/
   - Verify page structure is announced

3. **Submit a Zip Code**
   - Enter "10001" in the form
   - Submit and listen for announcements

4. **Verify Stage Announcements**
   - Should hear: "Step 1 of 3: Looking up your location"
   - Should hear: "Step 2 of 3: Getting weather data"  
   - Should hear: "Step 3 of 3: Complete: Weather data loaded"

5. **Check Announcement Quality**
   - Are announcements clear and helpful?
   - Are they announced at appropriate times?
   - Are they not too frequent or annoying?
   - Do they use polite mode (not interrupting)?

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Stage changes are announced
- ‚úÖ Announcements are clear and timely
- ‚úÖ Uses polite mode (doesn't interrupt)
- ‚úÖ Provides context ("Step X of 3")

3. **Submit a Zip Code**
   - Enter "10001" and submit
   - Watch the animation

4. **Verify Behavior**
   - Animations should be instant or very short
   - Stage transitions should still occur
   - Functionality should work normally
   - No jarring motion or long animations

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Animation durations near-instant (0.01ms)
- ‚úÖ Stage transitions still visible but quick
- ‚úÖ No pulse or flow animations

### ‚ö° Performance Testing (Lighthouse)

**Prerequisites:**
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Preview server: `npm run preview` (usually port 4173)

**Option 1: Chrome DevTools**

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Lighthouse tab
3. Select categories: Performance, Accessibility
4. Choose Desktop or Mobile
5. Click "Generate report"

**Option 2: CLI**

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# In another terminal:
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4173 --view
```

**Target Scores:**
- ‚úÖ Performance: >= 90
- ‚úÖ Accessibility: = 100
- ‚úÖ Best Practices: >= 90

## üìù Testing Notes

### What's Already Verified:
- ‚úÖ All automated tests pass
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Code includes accessibility attributes
- ‚úÖ Reduced motion CSS is present
- ‚úÖ Educational comments comprehensive
- ‚úÖ README documentation complete
- ‚úÖ Component is non-interactive (no focus issues)

### What Needs Manual Testing:
- ‚è≥ Screen reader announcements (VoiceOver/NVDA)
- ‚è≥ Reduced motion behavior
- ‚è≥ Lighthouse audit scores
- ‚è≥ Mobile device testing (optional)

### Why Manual Testing is Needed:
The remaining tests require:
1. Real assistive technologies (screen readers)
2. OS-level settings (reduced motion)
3. Network access (Lighthouse)
4. Human judgment (UX quality)

These cannot be fully automated but are critical for ensuring an inclusive, accessible experience.
