- ✅ Configured Cursor IDE integration
- ✅ Installed markdown-tree-parser for document sharding

#### 1.2 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- ✅ Created comprehensive PRD with PM agent
- ✅ Defined 9 Functional Requirements
- ✅ Defined 6 Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ Created 1 Epic with 6 User Stories
- ✅ Sharded into 8 focused documents

**Key Decisions:**
- Use National Weather Service API (free, no key required)
- Target US zip codes only
- Deploy to Vercel (zero cost)
- Focus on simplicity and speed

#### 1.3 Architecture Document
- ✅ Created comprehensive architecture with Architect agent
- ✅ Selected tech stack: Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Designed data models and API integration patterns
- ✅ Created testing strategy (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- ✅ Documented security and performance requirements
- ✅ Sharded into 16 focused documents

**Tech Stack:**
- Build Tool: Vite 5.0
- Language: TypeScript 5.x
- CSS: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- Testing: Vitest + Playwright
- Deployment: Vercel

#### 1.4 Document Sharding
- ✅ Installed @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
- ✅ Sharded PRD → 8 files
- ✅ Sharded Architecture → 16 files
- ✅ Created organized docs structure

### Phase 2: Development - Epic 1 (IN PROGRESS)

#### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**: October 16, 2025

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ package.json with all dependencies
- ✅ Vite configuration for dev and build
- ✅ TypeScript configuration (strict mode)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS setup with PostCSS
- ✅ ESLint + Prettier configuration
- ✅ Vitest testing framework
- ✅ Basic HTML structure (index.html)
- ✅ Application entry point (src/main.ts)
- ✅ Global styles with CSS variables
- ✅ Comprehensive README
- ✅ .gitignore for clean repository
- ✅ Weather icon favicon

**Verification:**
- ✅ `npm install` - 341 packages installed
- ✅ `npm run build` - Production build successful
- ✅ `npm run lint` - Linting passes (2 warnings acceptable)
- ✅ `npm run type-check` - TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ `npm run test` - Test framework configured
- ✅ Git commit created with descriptive message

**Files Created:** 42 files, 8,093 lines of code

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Implement Story 1.2** - Create zip code input form with validation
2. **Implement Story 1.3** - Integrate with National Weather Service API
3. **Implement Story 1.4** - Build weather display component
4. **Implement Story 1.5** - Add comprehensive error handling
5. **Implement Story 1.6** - Deploy to Vercel and finalize documentation

## 📊 Metrics

- **Planning Phase**: ~2 hours (PRD, Architecture, Sharding)
- **Story 1.1 Implementation**: ~30 minutes
- **Total Stories**: 6
- **Completed Stories**: 1 (17%)
- **Estimated Completion**: 4-5 more stories to implement

## 💡 BMAD Method Benefits Observed

1. **Clear Requirements**: PRD provided unambiguous acceptance criteria
2. **Architecture Guidance**: Tech stack decisions made upfront, no mid-project changes
3. **Sharded Documents**: Easy to reference specific sections during development
4. **Structured Stories**: Each story is self-contained and testable
5. **AI-Friendly**: All documentation is optimized for AI agent implementation
6. **Version Control**: Clean git history with descriptive commits
